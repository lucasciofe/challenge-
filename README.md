This project discusses the importance of using the right semantic elements for accessibility
rather than using only the div element, it has a wide variety of elements to define such as
`header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside` and etc.
You can see more the definition of each in [HTML Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).
